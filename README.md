# Architecture ML Monitoring

This project aims to detect anomalies in architectural structures by leveraging machine learning techniques applied to sensor data. The system monitors changes in environmental factors (such as humidity, temperature, vibrations, etc.) and predicts potential material degradation, while also identifying the specific contributing factors. This enables proactive maintenance and ensures structural integrity.
